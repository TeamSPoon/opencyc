Provides a finite domain constraint solver optimized to work with OpenCyc.<p>

A finite domain constraint problem consists of a set of variables each of which 
has a finite set of possible values.  The problem also has a set of constraint rules
which are relations among one or more of the constraint variables.  The solution to 
the constraint problem consists of the set of variable bindings to domain values which
satisfy all the constraint rules.<p>

This implementation of a finite domain constraint solver features the Forward Checking
algorithm, which dramatically prunes the solution search space.  Furthermore, a
unique technique of lazy variable domain extension reduces the size of the variable
domain data structure and the associated effort to maintain them.<p>

OpenCyc enables backchaining inference to be combined with constraint solving so that the
constraint rules may be transformed via modus ponens, and additional rules from the 
Knowledge Base can be automatically added to the problem together with their argument
type constraints.<p>

Many Knowledge Base queries have a form which is suitable for imput to the OpenCyc 
constraint solver.<p>

This package is supported by the {@link org.opencyc.cycobject} package.
