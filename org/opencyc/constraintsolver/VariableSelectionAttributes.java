 * <tt>VariableSelectionAttributes</tt> object to model the attributes and sort behavior
 * of a variable and its associated selection attributes.  The first selection
 * attribute is the size of the remaining value domain.  The second selection
 * attribute is the number of forward constraint rules which apply to this variable.
 * A forward constraint rule is one which uses only the current variable and future
 * (yet to be considered) variables.<p>
